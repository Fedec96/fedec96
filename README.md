# Ciao! I'm Federico.

Since the early age of 8 I have developed a passion for the world of the personal computer, starting from hardware and games and coming soon to programming. I am always paying top attention to the smallest details, even for those that are of no interest to anyone. This has always made me a unique person in the environments I have worked in (so far).

Being a purist and perfectionist are my strengths and weaknesses.

## My background

Back when I was 19 I managed to find my first job as a `COBOL` developer for the biggest banks and insurance companies in Europe. I worked full-time exclusively in an IBM environment, through an IBM-3270 emulator that made `COBOL`/`DB2`/`JCL` developing possible.

After four years I spent two more years developing with the very same technologies on an IBM-AS400 emulator, for the biggest fashion companies in Europe.

Having worked six years in the past, I decided it was time to move on.

## Present day

I am currently working as a front-end developer in the world of the aerospace research, doing my best to help protect the environment and preserve our precious resources. I am now working with the objective of becoming a great `JavaScript` and `Python` developer.
